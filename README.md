# DictionaryCPP

The main objective of this project is to create a dictionary library in data structures using linked lists. The 
application will allow users to search for words that start with the same set of letters as well as to search for 
synonyms and antonyms. In addition, the users will be able to add more words to the dictionary by first checking 
for duplication before inserting new words. Moreover, users would have the option to remove or modify some 
words/synonyms/antonyms in the dictionary.
